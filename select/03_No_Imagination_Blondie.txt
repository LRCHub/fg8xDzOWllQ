Eyes that tell me, baby
You don't need no invitation
Let me smoke another cigarette
Before I make a move

I can see me in the morning
Losing my direction
Deep inside my overcoat
Looking for the door

I don't wanna stay with you
I just wanna play with you
One sweet abbreviation
Sleeping like the dead

You think you're pretty, well, so do I
You came to me but passion dies
Got no imagination
To clutter up my head

Eyes that mirror innocence
And cannot sense the changes
Let's have another drink, dear
Before we get deranged

I can see me in the morning
Avoiding your detection
Slowly down the staircase
Looking for the door

I don't wanna stay with you
I just wanna play with you
One sweet abbreviation
Sleeping like the dead

You think you're pretty well so do I
You came to me but passion dies
Got no imagination
To clutter up my head

All is fair in love and war
So, I don't want your love no more
One sweet abbreviation
Sleeping like the dead

You're fragile and you're very green
Conditioned by a milk machine
Got no imagination, got no imagination
No, take a walk kid

Eyes that tell me, baby
You don't need no invitation
Let me smoke another cigarette
Before I make a move

I can see me in the morning
Losing my direction
Deep inside my overcoat
Footsteps for the door
